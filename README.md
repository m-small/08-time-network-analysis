# Core skills program - week 8 - Optimisation and special data types

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/core-skills/08-time-network-analysis.git/master)

The aim of today's session will be to provide an introduction to certain common "special data types", and also give an overview of the basic ideas behind optimisation. We will look at the general purpose optimisation techniques known as Genetic Algorithms and design out own simple examples. The remainder of the session will focus on two special data types: time series, and networks. We have seen the basic ideas behind both types of data in previous weeks, but in this week we will build on those ideas with the specific purposes of predicting and simulating time series, and optimising network performance.

You should aim to understand (1) optimisation in the context of computation - what optimisation can do and how it does it, (2) simulation and prediction of time series (how to do it and how these two things differ), and (3) quantify, characterise and visualise networks using the networkx package. 

We will finish the day by working through a case study which brings all these ideas to optimise the performance and maintanence of a meteroploitan utility network. At the end of the case study you will be able to idenitfy key challenges and straetgies to understand and model the performance of interconencted systems.

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

**Todo:** add pre-session reading and resources (and _why_ you might like to read them - see [week two's README](https://github.com/core-skills/02-getting-to-know-the-tools/blob/master/README.md) as an example)
